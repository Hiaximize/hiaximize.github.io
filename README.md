This project was created by Derek Barker for his first General Assembly Project. 

You can get information for 20 Rick & Morty Characters. As they add more characters to the database you will be able to access more. There are buttons for the core characters and then you can use the custom search bar to find additional characters. 

You can use ???? to cycle through all the possible characters. 

Technologies used to create this page were HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and AJAX. 

I initially laid out the html structure, then began to add the functionality using JS and JQuery. The final step was the styling.
